# BloodStreamPortal

This is my final project while learning with CDAC.

For running front end please open the file location in command prompt and pass the command npm install (prefer to pass this command in folder which has package.json file).
After npm install command to start the front end pass the command npm start in src folder.
Backend part can be imported in STS and you can make changes in application properties file as per your requirements (MySQL username, password or database name etc.)
Start the backend server and you are ready to go.
